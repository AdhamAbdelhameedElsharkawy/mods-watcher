Thank you for your interest in improving ModsWatcher! To ensure the project remains stable for the community, please follow these guidelines.

🌿 Branch Naming Patterns
When submitting a Pull Request, please ensure your branch follows these naming conventions:

Features: feature/name-of-feature (e.g., feature/nexus-scraper)

Bug Fixes: fix/issue-description (e.g., fix/xpath-parsing-error)

Documentation: docs/update-readme

Refactoring: refactor/cleanup-db-logic

🛡️ Pull Request Process
The main branch is protected to prevent direct pushes and ensure code quality.

Fork the Repository: Create your own copy of the project.

Create a Branch: Use the patterns mentioned above.

Submit a PR: Once your changes are ready, open a Pull Request against the main branch.

Approval Required: All PRs require at least one approval from the project maintainer before they can be merged.

No Force Pushing: Force pushes are blocked on the main branch to maintain a clean history.

📝 Coding Standards
Ensure no local file paths are hardcoded in the final submission.

Update the README if your change adds new functionality to the Watcher or Library views.
